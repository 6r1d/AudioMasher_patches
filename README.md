# An archive of AudioMasher patches

This repository contains an archive of [AudioMasher](https://audiomasher.org/) [audio scripts](https://audiomasher.org/browse).
It will be useful if the server is down.

[Archive](./archive) directory contains the scripts, sorted by author.
Each script has a header with creation date, author and URL.

[Dumper src](./dumper_src) directory contains current dumpers.
My initial dumper is written using Python3 / Selenium.
